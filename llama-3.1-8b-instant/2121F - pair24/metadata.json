  "bug_description_natural_language": "The buggy solution declares the answer counter `ans` as an `int`. The total number of valid subarrays can exceed the maximum value of a 32-bit integer, leading to an integer overflow and a wrong final count. The correct solution resolves this by declaring `ans` as a `long long` to ensure it can store the potentially large result without overflowing.",
