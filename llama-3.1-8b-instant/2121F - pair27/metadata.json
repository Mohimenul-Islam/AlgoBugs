  "bug_description_natural_language": "The buggy solution declares the result variable `res` and the return type of the `calc` function as `int`. The total number of valid subarrays can exceed the maximum value of a 32-bit integer, leading to an integer overflow and a wrong final count. The correct solution resolves this by changing the type of `res` and the return type of `calc` to `long long`, ensuring it can store the potentially large result without overflowing.",
