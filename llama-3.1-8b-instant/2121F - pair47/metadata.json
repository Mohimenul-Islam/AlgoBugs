  "bug_description_natural_language": "The buggy solution attempts to find the range of valid starting indices `[lo, ro]` for each ending index `i` by using linear scans. The loops `for(int j=0;j<n;j++)` and `for(int j=ti;j>=0;j--)` iterate through the vector of potential starting indices stored in the map `mp`. This linear search within the main loop leads to a high time complexity, causing a Time Limit Exceeded error. The correct solution replaces these inefficient linear scans with `std::lower_bound` and `std::upper_bound`. These functions perform a binary search to find the range of valid starting indices much more efficiently, reducing the complexity and allowing the solution to pass within the time limit.",
