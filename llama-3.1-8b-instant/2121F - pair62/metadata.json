  "bug_description_natural_language": "The buggy solution uses `int` for several variables, including `s`, `x`, and the elements of the prefix sum array `sum`. However, the problem constraints specify that these values can be large, potentially exceeding the capacity of a standard 32-bit integer. This leads to integer overflow, causing incorrect calculations and a 'Wrong Answer' verdict. The correct solution addresses this by using `#define int long long`, which effectively changes all instances of `int` to `long long`, ensuring that all variables can accommodate the large values required by the problem.",
