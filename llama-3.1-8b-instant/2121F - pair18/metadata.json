  "bug_description_natural_language": "The buggy solution uses a standard Python `defaultdict` which is susceptible to hash collision attacks. On test cases designed to cause many collisions, the dictionary's performance degrades, leading to a Time Limit Exceeded verdict. The correct solution mitigates this by XORing each key with a large random number before using it with the dictionary. This randomization of keys prevents targeted hash collisions and restores the expected average-case performance.",
