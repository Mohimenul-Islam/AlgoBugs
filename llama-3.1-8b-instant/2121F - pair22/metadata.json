  "bug_category": "Implementation,Resource Management,Static Buffer Overflow",
  "bug_description_natural_language": "The buggy solution defines a constant `MAX` as `1e2+10`, which is 110. The arrays `a` and `sum` are declared with this size. However, the problem constraints state that `n` can be up to 200,000. When a test case with `n` larger than 110 is used, the code attempts to access memory outside the bounds of these arrays, leading to a static buffer overflow. This results in undefined behavior, which manifests as a 'WRONG_ANSWER' verdict. The correct solution fixes this by defining `MAX` as `2e5+10`, ensuring the arrays are large enough to handle the maximum possible input size.",
