  "bug_description_natural_language": "The buggy solution fails due to Time Limit Exceeded (TLE) for two primary reasons. First, it uses `std::unordered_map`, which is susceptible to performance degradation on test cases that cause hash collisions, leading to near O(N) complexity for operations instead of the average O(1). The correct solution uses `std::map`, which guarantees O(log N) performance and avoids this issue. Second, the buggy code is missing essential C++ I/O optimizations (`ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0); cin.tie(0);`), which significantly slows down input and output operations. The combination of an inefficient data structure choice for the specific test data and slow I/O leads to the TLE verdict. The buggy solution also contains a logical flaw where it checks for valid subarrays and then uses `continue`, which is redundant and alters the control flow unnecessarily.",
