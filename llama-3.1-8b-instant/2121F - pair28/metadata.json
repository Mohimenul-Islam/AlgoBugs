  "bug_description_natural_language": "The buggy solution creates a copy of the vector of indices from the map in each iteration with the line `vi v = mapi[cur_sum - sum];`. When the vector associated with a prefix sum becomes large, this copying operation is very slow and leads to a Time Limit Exceeded error. The correct solution avoids this inefficiency by directly accessing the vector in the map (`mapi[cur_sum - sum]`) without creating a copy, which significantly improves performance.",
