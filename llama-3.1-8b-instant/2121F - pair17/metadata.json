  "bug_description_natural_language": "The buggy solution experiences a Time Limit Exceeded error due to an inefficiency in the main loop. Inside the loop, it copies a vector of indices from a map using `vi temp = mp1[req]`. As the map grows, this vector can become large, and copying it in every iteration leads to a quadratic time complexity in the worst case. The correct solution avoids this by directly accessing the vector in the map (`mp1[req]`) without creating a copy, maintaining the intended O(N log N) complexity.",
