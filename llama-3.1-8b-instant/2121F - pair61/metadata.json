  "bug_description_natural_language": "The buggy solution has a flawed approach to handling prefix sums within valid segments. When an element `arr[i] == x` is found, it attempts to update the map `mp` with prefix sums from the previous valid segment. However, the calculation `p[j+1] - p[cn + 1]` is incorrect. It tries to re-base the prefix sums relative to the start of the current segment (`cn`), but this is not how prefix sum counting works and leads to incorrect lookups. The correct solution simplifies this by storing the absolute prefix sums `p[j+1]` in the map. The logic correctly identifies valid segments and uses the standard prefix sum technique on the absolute sums, which is the correct way to solve this type of problem.",
