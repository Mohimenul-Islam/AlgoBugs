  "bug_description_natural_language": "The buggy solution uses `int` for the prefix sum array and for the keys in its map. As the array elements are summed up, the total can exceed the maximum value storable in a 32-bit integer, causing an integer overflow. This results in incorrect prefix sum values, leading to wrong lookups in the map and ultimately a 'WRONG_ANSWER' verdict. The correct solution prevents this by using `int64_t` (long long) for the variables that store sums and for the map keys, ensuring they can hold the larger values without overflowing.",
