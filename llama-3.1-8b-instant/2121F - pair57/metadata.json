  "bug_category": "Data Type,Integer Overflow,Incorrect type for variable",
  "bug_description_natural_language": "The buggy solution declares the variables `s` and `x` as `int`. However, the problem constraints specify that `s` can be as large as 10^18, which exceeds the capacity of a standard 32-bit integer. This leads to an integer overflow when reading the input, causing the program to work with an incorrect value for `s` and produce a 'Wrong Answer'. The correct solution fixes this by declaring `s` as `long long` (`ll`), which can accommodate the large values specified in the problem.",
