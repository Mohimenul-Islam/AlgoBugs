  "bug_description_natural_language": "The solution is algorithmically correct but fails due to a performance issue. It uses `std::map` for counting prefix sum frequencies, which has O(log N) time complexity for lookups and insertions. This is too slow for the problem's constraints. The corrected version uses `std::unordered_map`, which provides average O(1) complexity, to avoid the Time Limit Exceeded error.",
