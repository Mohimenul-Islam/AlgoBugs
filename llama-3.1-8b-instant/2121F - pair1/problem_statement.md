## Problem Statement

You are given an array of integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ and two integers $$$s$$$ and $$$x$$$. Count the number of subsegments of the array whose sum of elements equals $$$s$$$ and whose maximum value equals $$$x$$$.More formally, count the number of pairs $$$1 \leq l \leq r \leq n$$$ such that: $$$a_l + a_{l + 1} + \ldots + a_r = s$$$.  $$$\max(a_l, a_{l + 1}, \ldots, a_r) = x$$$.

## Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \leq t \leq 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$s$$$, and $$$x$$$ ($$$1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5$$$, $$$-2 \cdot 10^{14} \leq s \leq 2 \cdot 10^{14}$$$, $$$-10^9 \leq x \leq 10^9$$$). The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$-10^9 \leq a_i \leq 10^9$$$).It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ across all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^5$$$.

## Output

For each test case, output the number of subsegments of the array whose sum of elements equals $$$s$$$ and whose maximum value equals $$$x$$$.

## Note

In the first test case, the suitable subsegment is $$$l = 1$$$, $$$r = 1$$$.In the third test case, the suitable subsegments are $$$l = 1$$$, $$$r = 1$$$ and $$$l = 3$$$, $$$r = 3$$$. In the fifth test case, the suitable subsegments are $$$l = 1$$$, $$$r = 3$$$ and $$$l = 6$$$, $$$r = 8$$$.In the sixth test case, the suitable subsegments are those for which $$$r = l + 2$$$. In the seventh test case, the following subsegments are suitable:  $$$l = 1$$$, $$$r = 7$$$. $$$l = 2$$$, $$$r = 7$$$. $$$l = 3$$$, $$$r = 6$$$. $$$l = 4$$$, $$$r = 8$$$. $$$l = 7$$$, $$$r = 11$$$. $$$l = 7$$$, $$$r = 12$$$. $$$l = 8$$$, $$$r = 10$$$. $$$l = 9$$$, $$$r = 13$$$.
