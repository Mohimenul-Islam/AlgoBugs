  "bug_description_natural_language": "The buggy solution uses a flawed algorithm to count subarrays. It incorrectly applies the prefix sum technique by using a wrong formula to find matching subarray sums. The nested loop structure is also inefficient and incorrect, failing to properly count subarrays that have `x` as their maximum value, unlike the correct inclusion-exclusion approach.",
